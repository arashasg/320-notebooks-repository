For this graph, each node is an independent Nashville Meetup, and each edge is the number of shared members between each group. Example: if PyNash has 100 members and 50 of them are also members of the Nashville Hiking MeetUp, there will be an edge between those two with a weight of 50.\n\nWe first import the data and create a graph, then we read in some group metadata. Next, we derive measures of the graph and add them to our dataframe.
