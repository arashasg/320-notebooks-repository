Suppose we want to find support for item B. Support(B) = (Transactions containing (B))/(Total Transactions)\n\nConfidence Confidence refers to the likelihood that an item B is also bought if item A is bought. It can be calculated by finding the number of transactions where A and B are bought together, divided by total number of transactions where A is bought. Confidence(A→B) = (Transactions containing both (A and B))/(Transactions containing A)\n\nLift Lift(A -> B) refers to the increase in the ratio of sale of B when A is sold. Lift(A –> B) can be calculated by dividing Confidence(A -> B) divided by Support(B). Mathematically it can be represented as: Lift(A→B) = (Confidence (A→B))/(Support (B))\n\nA Lift of 1 means there is no association between products A and B. Lift of greater than 1 means products A and B are more likely to be bought together. Finally, Lift of less than 1 refers to the case where two products are unlikely to be bought together.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"356c2ed5a88b92688cd6eb58318eaa1670f5b102"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np  \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt  \nimport pandas as pd  \n\n# we need to install mlxtend on anaconda prompt by typing 'pip install mlxtend'\nfrom mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori  \nfrom mlxtend.frequent_patterns import association_rules\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f631aa4ed7b41745c56c1b6b9c9cb0252e0dd91b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"store_data = pd.read_csv('../input/BreadBasket_DMS.csv') ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8df5ee5c286d6f8fca62d9c87c9d71f5bd71413a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# lets visualize which items are more popular.\n\nItems={}\nfor item in store_data['Item']:\n    if item in Items:\n        Items[item]= Items[item] + 1\n    else:\n        Items[item]=1\n        \nkeys=[]\nvals=[]\nfor i,k in Items.items():\n    if k>30:\n        keys.append(i)\n        vals.append(k)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"332b2b3138cbf6de903c6d0af4a4cc0e770862f1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.bar(keys, vals, label=\"Items sold in 2017\")\nplt.rcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = [20,10]\nplt.ylabel ('Number of Transactions in Percentage')\nplt.xlabel ('Items Sold')\nplt.xticks(list(keys), rotation=90)\nplt.legend (bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1), loc=\"best\", borderaxespad=0.)\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a1545b531b6f7ded9757e384d2d0705f182bdd4c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This analysis requires that all the data for a transaction be included in 1 row and the items should be 1-hot encoded."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2567c5bcce73bf3159e387a148fa78f21a60eeb9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"store_data['Quantity']= 1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"9c6a7f343e7557cb13cd5000218883b956870fef"},"cell_type":"code","source":"store_data.head(7)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"310a6d27341cb86a342598859782443f8cadfeca"},"cell_type":"code","source":"basket = store_data.groupby(['Transaction', 'Item'])['Quantity'].sum().unstack().fillna(0)\nprint(basket.head())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e99fe3f04ef55f5ad137a23d8abb07af221008d3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# There are a lot of zeros in the data but we also need to make sure any positive values are converted to a 1 \n# and anything less the 0 is set to 0.
