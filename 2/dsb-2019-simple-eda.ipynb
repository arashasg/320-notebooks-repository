Each **assessment** is designed to test a child's comprehension of a certain set of measurement-related skills.

Possible values are: 'Game', 'Assessment', 'Activity', 'Clip'.\n* `world` - The section of the application the game or video belongs to. Helpful to identify the educational curriculum goals of the media.
