This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can use immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.\n\nThis data set provides information to help you predict what behavior will help you to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.\n\nThe dataset includes information about:\n\nCustomers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn\nServices that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies\nCustomer account information – how long they had been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges\nDemographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import itertools\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.ticker import NullFormatter\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.ticker as ticker\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\n%matplotlib inline\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data exploration.\n ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\npath='../input/telecommunications/teleCust1000t.csv'\ndf = pd.read_csv(path)\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Let’s see how many of each class is in our data set ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['custcat'].value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### So : 281 Plus Service, 266 Basic-service, 236 Total Service, and 217 E-Service customers","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"len(df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.hist(column='income', bins=100)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lets define now feature sets , X :","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nX= df[['region', 'tenure','age', 'marital', 'address', 'income', 'ed', 'employ','retire', 'gender', 'reside']] .values\nX[0:3]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lets define now our labels , Y :","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Y= df['custcat'].values\nY[0:3]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Normalize data","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Data Standardization give data zero mean and unit variance, it is good practice, especially for algorithms such as KNN which is based on distance of cases:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X).transform(X.astype(float))\nX[0:3]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Train Test Split  \nOut of Sample Accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions that the model makes on data that that the model has NOT been trained on.

So how can we improve out-of-sample accuracy? One way is to use an evaluation approach called Train/Test Split.\nTrain/Test Split involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets respectively, which are mutually exclusive. After which, you train with the training set and test with the testing set. \n\nThis will provide a more accurate evaluation on out-of-sample accuracy because the testing dataset is not part of the dataset that have been used to train the data.
